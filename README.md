# FoodTruckProject

##Overview:
Users will input and rate a list of food trucks, then view the average rating and the highest-rated truck.

## Description
The FoodTruck class has been created with fields for a unique numeric id, a name, food type, and a numeric rating. There is a separate class with a main method that starts the program. It an array to store up to five FoodTruck objects. 


## Technologies
During the course of developing this solution, I was able to apply several of SD week two lessons.  The lab provided an opportunity to practice encapsulation and object array manipulation.  It was also good opportunity to practice nested loops.  


## Lessons learned
When developing code to address problems as complex such as this one, it is always a good idea to create a plan before starting to code. Personally, the Truck ID feature seemed to be one of the more difficult aspects of this assignment. In the end, I developed TruckID and NextTruckID, where only one of them was static.
